Theremin sensors theory
=======================

In theremins, sound is being controlled by distance of hands from two "antennas" (rods or plates of metal).

* Pitch antenna controls sound frequency (note).
* Volume antenna controls gain.

Theremin should sense hand to antenna distances, and synthesize output signal of proper pitch and volume.

Distance of hand to antenna changes antenna capacitance.

Theremin antenna is actually working as capacitor electrode. 

Capacitance of antenna seen by theremin can be divided into fixed and variable parts.

* C_ant is antenna self capacitance and capacitance from antenna to environment which is considered as non changing

* C_hand is capacitance varying mostly depending on distance from hand to antenna
